          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The game on this site is modeled on a popular video game from the late 1980s, called Boxxle.  Although there are emulators for this game, this site is a complete re-write of the game utilizing web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery). Everything that you need to play the game was downloaded as part of this webpage.  There is nothing for you to install.  Each time you wish to play the game, all you have to do is visit this site.  We are leveraging the latest technologies from HTML5 to save your game statistics so you can keep track of your previous scores.The game is light weight and demands very little resources from your system.  Because of this, we were able to optimize the game for all modern laptop and desktop systems.  Our next release will include full support for touch based systems such as smartphones and tablets</p>

          <p>As you can see in the vdeo above, the game requires very little instructions to play.  What you see above is level 1 of the game.  Your job is to move all the crates until they are positioned in the squares that have dots on them.  As you complete each level successfully, you will be automatically transported to the next level.  Each level is more difficult than the previous level.  The goal is to complete all 16 levels. When you first enter the site, you will be prompted to enter your name or login name you want to be known as.  We use your name to track your current and previous scores.  These will be displayed on the game page.

          <p id="gameBoyPlatform">Boxxle was originally released in September of 1989 for the Game Boy platform.  The Boxxle development team was from the<b> "Thinking Rabbit" </b> software house based in Takarazuka, Japan.The Game Boy platform was released the same year that the Boxxle game development was completed.  Although the Game Boy is weak by todays standards with its 8-bit processor, a clock rate of 4.19 Mhz and 8kB of internal video memory, it was technically advance for its time. It brought increased visibility to the company who manufactured the device; Nintendo.</p>
